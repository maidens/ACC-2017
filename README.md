Code to generate figures from the paper "Symmetry reduction for dynamic programming with application to MRI" by John Maidens, Axel Barrau, Silv√®re Bonnabel, and Murat Arcak, submitted to the 2017 American Control Conference

Two Jupyter notebooks are included. The notebook DP_MR_fingerprinting.ipynb computes the optimal control input using dynamic programming on a six-dimensional grid (in the standard coordinates). The notebook DP_MR_fingerprinting_reduced.ipynb exploits symmetry to compute the same optimal control using dynamic programming on a reduced five-dimensional grid. The files DynamicProgramming.jl and DynamicProgrammingReduced.jl contain Julia code that implements the dynamic programming algorithm in each case. In addition, the data file J_full.jld contains the optimal cost-to-go function evaluated at all the grid points for the six-dimensional case (since it takes a few hours to run). 

Tested in Julia 0.4.0 with the following packages: 
- Interpolations version 0.3.5
- HDF5 version 0.6.1
- JLD version 0.6.0
- Gadfly version 0.4.2
- Colors version 0.5.4
